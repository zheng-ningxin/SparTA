This experiment may take days to run if we follow the setup mentioned in the paper(training epochs=300). To save the time, we set a small epoch number here in `run.sh`(epoch=20), to fully reproduce the number in the paper, please set the FINETUNE_EPOCH=300 and rerun the script.

Besides, we also provide the log file we used in the paper `paper_Iterative_SA.log` and `paper_Iterative_SA.log.baseline`.
